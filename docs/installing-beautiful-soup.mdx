title: Installing BeautifulSoup
---

If you’re using a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Beautiful Soup with the system package manager:


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="pyhton2" label="Python 2">

```shell
$ apt-get install python-bs4
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python3" label="Python 3">

```shell
$ apt-get install python3-bs4
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Beautiful Soup 4 is published through PyPi, so if you can’t install it with the system packager, you can install it with `easy_install` or `pip`. The package name is `beautifulsoup4`, and the same package works on Python 2 and Python 3. Make sure you use the right version of `pip` or `easy_install` for your Python version (these may be named `pip3` and `easy_install3` respectively if you’re using Python 3).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="easy_install" label="easy install">

```shell
$ easy_install beautifulsoup4
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

```shell
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

(The `BeautifulSoup` package is probably not what you want. That’s the previous major release, [Beautiful Soup 3](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs3/documentation.html). Lots of software uses BS3, so it’s still available, but if you’re writing new code you should install `beautifulsoup4`.)

If you don’t have `easy_install` or `pip` installed, you can [download the Beautiful Soup 4 source tarball](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/4.0/) and install it with `setup.py`.

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

If all else fails, the license for Beautiful Soup allows you to package the entire library with your application. You can download the tarball, copy its `bs4` directory into your application’s codebase, and use Beautiful Soup without installing it at all.

I use Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 to develop Beautiful Soup, but it should work with other recent versions.

## Problems after installation

Beautiful Soup is packaged as Python 2 code. When you install it for use with Python 3, it’s automatically converted to Python 3 code. If you don’t install the package, the code won’t be converted. There have also been reports on Windows machines of the wrong version being installed.

If you get the `ImportError` “No module named HTMLParser”, your problem is that you’re running the Python 2 version of the code under Python 3.

If you get the `ImportError` “No module named html.parser”, your problem is that you’re running the Python 3 version of the code under Python 2.

In both cases, your best bet is to completely remove the Beautiful Soup installation from your system (including any directory created when you unzipped the tarball) and try the installation again.

If you get the `SyntaxError` “Invalid syntax” on the line `ROOT_TAG_NAME = u'[document]'`, you need to convert the Python 2 code to Python 3. You can do this either by installing the package:

```shell
$ python3 setup.py install
```

or by manually running Python’s `2to3` conversion script on the `bs4` directory:

```txt
$ 2to3-3.2 -w bs4
```

## Installing a parser

Beautiful Soup supports the HTML parser included in Python’s standard library, but it also supports a number of third-party Python parsers. One is the [lxml parser](https://lxml.de/). Depending on your setup, you might install lxml with one of these commands:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="apt-get" label="apt-get">

```shell
$ apt-get install python-lxml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="easy_install" label="easy install">

```shell
$ easy_install lxml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

```shell
$ pip install lxml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



Another alternative is the pure-Python [html5lib parser](https://github.com/html5lib/), which parses HTML the way a web browser does. Depending on your setup, you might install html5lib with one of these commands:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="apt-get" label="apt-get">

```shell
$ apt-get install python-html5lib
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="easy_install" label="easy install">

```shell
$ easy_install html5lib
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

```shell
$ pip install html5lib
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This table summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each parser library:




If you can, I recommend you install and use lxml for speed. If you’re using a version of Python 2 earlier than 2.7.3, or a version of Python 3 earlier than 3.2.2, it’s essential that you install lxml or html5lib–Python’s built-in HTML parser is just not very good in older versions.

Note that if a document is invalid, different parsers will generate different Beautiful Soup trees for it. See Differences between parsers for details.
